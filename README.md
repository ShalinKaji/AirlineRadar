## **Project Overview:**
<p> AirFlow is an advanced time series analysis project that utilizes the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast international air passenger traffic. The project demonstrates the application of sophisticated statistical techniques to real-world data, providing valuable insights for the aviation industry and travel sector. </p>

### *Key Components:*
<ol>
<li> **Data Preparation and Visualization:**
The project begins by loading and preparing the 'AirPassengers' dataset, which contains monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. The data is visualized using matplotlib to provide an initial understanding of the trends and patterns. </li>


Data Splitting
The dataset is split into training (1949-1957) and testing (1958-1960) sets. This division allows for model training on historical data and evaluation on unseen future data1
.
Stationarity Testing
ARIMA requires non-stationary data. The project includes stationarity testing using ACF (Autocorrelation Function) plots to visualize the degree of correlation at different lag values1
.
Baseline Linear Model
A linear regression model is implemented as a baseline for comparison. This model includes a linear time trend and provides fitted values along with a 95% prediction interval1
.
ARIMA Model Implementation
The core of the project is the implementation of the ARIMA model using the auto_arima function from the pmdarima library. This function automatically selects the optimal ARIMA parameters, considering both seasonal and non-seasonal components1
.
Model Evaluation
The ARIMA model's performance is evaluated through various methods:
Residual analysis, including standardized residuals plotting
ACF plot of residuals
Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation
Forecasting
The trained ARIMA model is used to generate forecasts for the test period (1958-1960). These predictions are presented with 95% confidence intervals1
.
Visualization of Results
The project concludes with comprehensive visualizations comparing the actual test data against the model's forecasts, including confidence intervals1
.
Technical Implementation
The project is implemented in Python, leveraging key libraries such as pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, statsmodels, and pmdarima. It demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques specific to time series data1
.
This comprehensive approach to time series forecasting showcases advanced data science skills and provides a valuable tool for predicting future trends in air passenger traffic, which could be crucial for strategic planning in the aviation industry.
